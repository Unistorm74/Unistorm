KOA api created by Wenyu
The following packages have been added to this project.

nodemon (used to run command "npm start" )
rest.http (all URLs used for testing functions have been added on this file)
using /Data/message.json to store data.
NOTE: to active this project, a node-modules needed to be added with all uploaded files. I have the limitations to upload the whole node_modules here.
